# üîç Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts customer churn. By analyzing a dataset of 10,000 customers, the system uncovers hidden behavioral patterns and helps businesses make informed retention decisions. The tool not only analyzes existing customer records but also allows for real-time prediction by entering new customer data.

## Project Overview

Goal: Predict if a customer will churn (leave the service) based on demographic, financial, and behavioral data using machine learning.

This project uses:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Imbalanced learning (SMOTE)
- Classification models like Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost
- SHAP for model explainability
- Flask for web interface
- Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Dataset

- Filename: churn_modeling.csv  
- Records: 10,000 customers  
- Columns: Customer ID, Geography, Gender, Age, Balance, Tenure, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary, and more  
- Target: Exited column (1 = churned, 0 = retained)

## Features

- Predict churn for an existing customer using ID  
- Predict churn status for new customer data  
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance  
- SHAP values for visual interpretation of model decisions  
- Dynamic EDA visualizations (univariate, bivariate, correlation)  
- Trained models with evaluation metrics (F1, Accuracy, Precision, Recall)  
- Clean and interactive frontend built with HTML/CSS/JS
